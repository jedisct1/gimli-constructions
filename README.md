# Gimli constructions

Cross-platform cryptographic constructions and implementations based on the
[Gimli permutation](https://gimli.cr.yp.to).

These implementations are portable across a wide range of platforms, including
big-endian architectures.

# These are now maintained within [libhydrogen](https://github.com/jedisct1/libhydrogen).
